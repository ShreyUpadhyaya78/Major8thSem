Shara Moore,What’s more to say about the computer really? I love all my Apple products. I am impressed by the fast shipping experience. They wasted no time and when I emailed about getting an invoice it came right away. This seller is top notch.
Cheryl Tilghman,"Loving my new MacBook Air laptop computer! My desktop Mac computer was great but I needed a laptop to travel with so this one was right on time! I love the usability, size and color! Only issue is I’m only able to print from printers with AirPrint. Can’t use a USB cord."
ATLANTIC SKY,Its perfect
Tracy baldoni,"I’ve had this laptop for almost a year and I absolutely love it.. I got the starlight color..a little pricey, but totally worth it. The battery life is amazing."
NF,"Portable, easy to use, easy to set up . Decent battery life ."
Christian Cribbs,I work from home so this was a Necessity!! Couldn’t love it any more!
Amazon Customer,"I have had my macbook for two months now and it is amazin, everyone compliments how sleek and smooth it looks and runs. If you are thinking about it please buy!! I would recommend this one over the 15 inch everyday because of how lights it is and if you are a student this is the perfect macbook for you!"
KarenPaty,Like
myjacksg,"good product, good price, would recommend to everyone"
Sharon S. Olson,She has been very happy with memory and speed so far
"Muy bonita, delgada y ligera. Es muy rápida. Venía muy bien asegurada en su caja. Con caja y todo peso como unas 6 libras",
"They run too small way too tight. And unfortunately, I threw away the box and bag so I cannot return them.",I bought this computer for my daughter for her freshman year in college. She loves it.
MD Havard,I’ve been happy with my purchase so far
Jose Duran,La laptop es eficiente y funciona excelentemente
BigJ,"I use this laptop for everything, and getting the free shipping on it was much cheaper than through apple"
KC,"I use the laptop for things such as browsing the web, occasional photo/video editing, some small spreadsheets, docs, emails, watching Youtube, Hulu, etc... pretty simple/basic stuff. I don't have 15 windows open and don't use it for work. Keyboard feels good (happy they replaced the butterfly keyboard), laptop is very responsive for my usages, has 2 - USB C ports, camera looks good, screen looks good, and only supports one external monitor. If you don't need multiple monitors and 15 windows open simultaneously it's a great laptop."
alchemist,"This was just what I was hoping it would be. It’s easy to toss around in my backpack. It’s fast and has wonderful graphics. I retired recently but still need a laptop and this does just about everything. I can even charge it on the same C cable I use for everything else although it does have a magnetic charging cable as well. I bought a 100 watt charging block with ports for everything and with that and whatever other electronics I need I still have a light backpack. It’s heavier than previous models but it’s put together better too, not to mention I got the upgraded memory as well. Great Apple product as usual."
Lukas,"This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money."
wfupa7672,"Purchased this on sale to replace a 11+ year old OG 15 inch Macbook Pro Retina, which still works perfectly despite the battery not holding a charge long. I tend to keep laptops for a long time and wanted to stay with Apple due to my experience with my last one. I waited on the M2 version for its upgrades over the M1, which I read is also a great computer. Love how fast it is, very snappy, and the specs are perfect for my heavy home office use. Setup was a breeze from an iCloud backup. Have used it on multiple Zoom and Teams video meetings and the new camera and speakers work awesome for this purpose. Hope this one lasts as long as the Mac Pro!"
Veronica,"Lightweight, HD Camera, High Resolution, and long battery life. The only thing I don't like is the cloud storage of my docs."
Mel,"My children are using these for their school and sometimes use them to play online games. They had never used a Mac before, but had used iPads, and had a small learning curve for these and were quickly comfortable using them on a daily basis. I know these are quality products that will last them a long time, which is why I wanted to put the money in now, so that we didn't have to buy a new laptop every 2 years. Very happy with our purchase."
Big Fan!,I've not been disappointed with any of my MacAir laptops
Interested Observer,"Arrived promptly and carefully delivered. M2 is a big step up, especially if you’ve been using anything pre-M1. Love it."
Reese,This MacBook was the best purchase I’ve ever made.
Tate Bloom,My last macbook was an ancient 2011 model - what an upgrade this one is.
Ralph Nordenhold,It's a Mac and they control the quality of the build from start to finish.No need to adjust the color!
Ally,First macbook and I love it.
shuai wang,"Compared with my old Lenovo laptop, the battery is far greater"
Ben Broom,Apple products speak for themselves. Our family has been using Macs for the last ten years and there is no way I could go back to a PC. The MacBook Air is lightweight and we purchased this for my daughter to start college with. She has already started using it and loves. It is perfect for a college student to carry in their backpack and it is very user friendly. According to college requirements this specific model is the mid range and very affordable. I did a lot of research and the best price I found was on Amazon and they also offer apple care. I wouldn't purchase this computer without apple care. It covers accidental breaks which with college students is necessary.
Joey P,A+
Fran Rendon,Excellent
paul montecalvo,Liked the sale price...that was he difference
Amazon Customer,Very nice and quick delivery.
Cliente de Amazon,primera ves q pruebo una macbook de lujo
Charles,My daughter loved this laptop
Pablo Gonzalez,"This one is my first MacBook ever, and I'm truly impressed by its performance, battery life is great for me (charge it every five to six days). The screen resolution is amazing. I'm in love with it. I live in Ecuador, and I waited almost 10 days to get it, package quality is amazing too."
Holly L.,It is perfect. Beautiful color. Exactly what I wanted.
Carl fuller,Awesome product. Package perfect. 2 thumbs up
Mark McGowan,Superb quality and performance. Perfect size. Quiet keyboard.
liupiaoliang,good
Ron,"Bought this for my daughter, so she can do school work. It works perfect for what is needed and the price is right. I feel that I got a quality computer at a reasonable price and will be purchasing another one this week for my son."
Mr_shen,"The price is very favorable, the service is also very good, the things are good, haha"
Big M,"I am really happy with my purchase coming from a MacBook Pro 2018 model. I had my eye on this MacBook air m2 in midnight and I could not be more impressed. Lightning-fast, good keyboard, liquid retina, and overall this computer is an upgrade. I highly recommend it.

in regard to shipping, it was very fast, and I managed to get same-day delivery."
T. J. Perkins,Excellent screen (pixelations?). FAST. LONG battery.
Amy,"Faster, thinner, the updates compared to my 2000 MacBook"
Kourtney,This was worth every penny and i would definitely would purchase again
jmk63,"Got it for the kid to use this fall in school. Solid, easy set up. Presumed to be very long lasting like most every  product. Bought one for myself last fall to replace my 2012 MacBook Pro 13”. Awesome deal and will buy again if the need arises"
Patty,I love everything about the MacBook air. I have always used Dell Insp and I loved it but there's a difference.
LABeachell,I love my Mac. It is very light weight and thin. Plenty of speed. Great battery life. One thing I don’t like is that the keyboard feels cheap compared to my previous machines. Performs quite well just feels less than Mac quality. I would still buy another!
Marla,Such an amazing laptop
No Brain cells on the beat,I wanted to get a Mac for over all stability when traveling and this does everything I need!
Jason A.,"New to the Mac book, learning it. I love it."
Pat,"Love my MacBook Air, and when my hubby's computer faded, we ordered this one for him. LOVE IT."
shuhuashen,Good
Sam Johnson,"I purchased my new Macbook Air in January in the dark blue color, wow, couldn't have expected a better upgrade. I was on my second battery with my 2015 Pro and it would last me just short of two hours with basic operation. I am honestly charging this Air once a week with normal use. Email, web browsing, photo uploads and simple editing. This computer handles it no problemo. I have also used iMovie to edit and export DJI Mini 3 Pro footage, and I really haven't noticed a huge battery suck with that. The screen is bright and crisp, the keyboard is precise, and the battery life is exceptional. USB-C cord allows me to charge from wall outlets and battery packs, another game changer. It is lightweight, durable and I couldn't have expected such a huge improvement with this replacement. Highly recommend. Speakers sound good too."
Marshall Moseson,"Excellent conversion and transfer of data. Light weight, great screen, and powerful. My mid 2014 MacBook was having keyboard and battery problems, so this was an effective upgrade."
Amazon Customer,"I really, really love this computer. I bought it because my old Air bit the dust, and knew I wanted another to replace it. The only difference that I genuinely noticed between this new computer and my old one is the sensitivity of the mouse pad. It took a few days for me to adapt to this new mouse pad, but once I did, I had no issues. Battery life is fantastic. I can easily spend all day on my computer and still have battery power the next day. The cord is also made of a flexible material, whereas the cord with my older computer was a rubber-bound wire, which had started to fray where it connected to the battery. This new material they use won't fray like my old one, as it is much more adaptable to being wrapped up."
Amazon Customer,Switched over from from a surface pro to a MacBook for home and work use and I'm really satisfied. Wonderful condition and design. Definitely worth the price!
John Underwood,"it came in 2 different boxes until I got to the apple box in the middle, and when I started to use it I was not disappointed !"
Owen Harvey,"I am a Computer Science student and work as a Data Analyst as well. I love this laptop. It has great performance, the battery life is incredible, and it gets tons of compliments from all of my tech friends. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a laptop. The lower RAM option is fine for almost anyone. Yes if you want to run games on this laptop I would recommend the higher ram, but for daily things such as editing, programming, or any basic school and work function the lower ram is more than enough."
Mbrewer,Daughter Loves it. Perfect for School.
Bakary,I just bought this new MacBook I highly recommend people to get this. I had a 2016 Mac MacBook and everything transferred over really quickly and smoothly. The battery life is great I could keep it on for about an hour and the battery life barely reduced. The midnight color is a beautiful color too.
Victoria,Loveeeeee my laptop!!!! Using it for college. Battery life is very long I don’t experience it heating up. Hasn’t froze on me!
Red,I got this because I wanted a laptop for traveling because my experiment in just using an iPad Pro failed. This thing is a beast and outperforms my iMac.
veronica,Creí que era touch cómo enseñaba en los videos pero no 👎 en cuando lo demás es ok.
GilBat,"Everything I expected, at a lower price."
Cesar,"Love my new laptop. No issues with shipping, no damages, works perfectly."
George,"I must first confess that I am an Apple fan. But that has not always been true. For years I was a Microsoft Bigot and had a windows based computer since the beginning. I switched in 2010 to Apple after a systems engineer explained the differences in architecture and the pros and cons of a closed architecture (Apple) vs an open architecture(Microsoft Windows). I obviously chose Apple and glad I did. Now yo this laptop.

Fast- super fast with long battery life. Though it has a bigger screen size the laptop is actually smaller than the 2014 13” MacBook Air that it replaced! You can’t go wrong with this laptop!"
Danny Boy,"I liked this laptop more than I expected, as a replacement for my 2012 macbook air. This laptop is much more powerful, light, sleek, and the keyboard is great. I was hesitant to move away from the 2012 mac air keyboard, but so far it has been great. My only gripe is that, when closed, the lid is slightly not lining up with the base. It is off very slightly, like .5mm or so, but it is noticeable if I run my finger down the edge. It is a small negative, but for the price of this product, and the expectation that you are getting a premium product, it is a disappointment. I would give the product a 4.5 because of this, but I can only choose 4 or 5"
Giuseppe Bonsera Pastorello,Excelente
Cierra,"Pros: Great battery life, sound quality, and display. Super light and the fingerprint sign-in is so convenient! I use this laptop for school and have never had any troubles.
Cons: gets a little slow and choppy if you tru to run games on it and there are no USB ports"
Jim D.,Great features. Works very well. Good price.
Ralph M. Amendola,My grandson loves this laptop. He as taken to using it like falling off a log. I am proud I gave it to him….
akram,Best for a new university student like me. I love it.
Steven Santora,I love this laptop. I have been a Windows user for most of my life. This is my first Macbook and it's amazing. Everything about it works so well. And I have recommended this to many of my friends.
Jerm,"I've long been a PC user, built my own pretty decent gaming rig a few years ago. I recently enrolled in school and decided I needed something portable. After reading reviews, I decided that this was the way to go.

I've used Windows my entire life and never really gave the idea of MacOS a thought, but I absolutely love it. It has some similarities to Linux, which I've used in the past. It syncs flawlessly to other Apple products (I already had the iPhone and AirPods,) which is really cool. I love using Messenger on my computer, a feature I never knew I needed.

As for the hardware, it's solid. The unit itself is very light, but still feels incredibly sturdy. My main complaint is how easily the surface smudges -- a minor issue. I just got a clear clamshell case for mine and it looks good without smudging. I don't use the camera much but I did play around with it for a little bit and it looks great. The keyboard is pretty much silent and the touchpad is nice, took a little getting used to coming from Windows but I figured it out after a few hours of use. The thumbprint touch pad works great and is super convenient. The display is gorgeous, incredibly rich colors and great contrast.

Overall, a great purchase. I was a little scared to go all-in and jump into MacOS, but I don' t have any regrets at all. I'd even consider getting an iMac now. Super impressed with the hardware, software and everything else on this machine. Highly recommend, even at MSRP."
richmac,"I replaced a 2014 macbook air with this one - more because the old one was failing then because I needed something new. I was surprised at how much larger the screen is, while the weight seems about the same. Functionality is fantastic, but way more than I need."
Do We Really Need So Much Stuff?,"I used to buy really expensive MacBook Pros and tried to make them last. The way Apple’s going now, planned obsolescence of software development outpacing hardware, I switched my strategy and bought less laptop at a time and I’m not expecting it to last so long. I have old laptops that were in great physical condition, but just cannot keep up with software needs for upgraded hardware. So far I love this little book, the screen is kind of small but it’s great that you can set up an iPad as a supplemental screen space solution."
ARAGON,"EL PRODUCTO LLEGO EN BUENAS CONDICIONES, SOY DE ECUADOR Y APROVECHE LA OFERTA, ADEMÁS EL PRODUCTO HA CUMPLIDO CON MIS EXPECTATIVAS, HA SIDO UNA BUENA COMPRA"
B Grvs,"What can I say? Love my Apple products. They work seamlessly with one another, and this one comes with the fingerprint unlock. Snappy response, great computer."
Maria,"It's my first MacBook and I'm absolutely excited
Best points for me:
Camera quality, lightless not a problem
Big Touch ID button (I tried the previous model and it has a thinner button and it looks uncomfortable)
MagSafe it's very convenient
The thin screen frame makes his laptop ideal in terms of the ratio of the size of the laptop and its screen

Midnight color looks stylish. Maybe fingers marks on the laptop are more noticeable than other colors but not as noticeable as described in the reviews"
Mac,"I was skeptical to buy this from Amazon, but this exceed all expectations. It was supposed to be delivered on the 9th and got here on the 4th. That alone was phenomenal cause I needed it for school. Don’t be a skeptic ordering from this seller if you need a computer. 5/5 rating ALL DAY 🙌🏼"
Mark ODell,The MacBook arrived on time and without any damage. The price was good for Mac.
D. P. Farr,I haven’t tried the camera yet so I couldn’t rate it. The battery life seems to be excellent. The processing is very fast.
Nick,These machines are fast and efficient.
Kindle Customer,Battery life is amazing and camera no complaints
Andrea,Honestly surprised just got it bought it used and looks new
Shiloh,"I did a massive amount of research on what I would need in a computer. I mostly use my computer for word, excel, and financial documents. I needed a computer that would be in my budget, would be fast and effective, but also would meet all of my needs for maintaining my household and doing different projects for work/school. This has fit the bill beautifully. It runs well, has an amazing screen and picture, and is so much faster than my previous computer! I'm so thrilled with my purchase!"
Jennifer Wilcox,"My grandson loves this. He is able to play, do schoolwork, and art. Good investment"
Debi Woolery,"It’s fast, efficient, and perfect"
Darcy Campbell,"I had a MacBook for over a decade and recently decided to upgrade and it did not disappoint! It’s fabulous, fast, compact, user friendly. I’m very pleased with my purchase."
I. Slonin,"I've only been using my new Mac for a couple weeks so far, but am enjoying the experience. Migration Assistant was a bit of a pain. Tried migrating nearly 300GB of files but it kept failing. Might have been my 10 year old Lenovo's fault. Finally managed to migrate files in smaller groups. I think everything migrated via WiFi although I had an ethernet cable connecting both laptops. Love the Touch ID!"
BillK,I have retired so I do not need all the features of a loaded MacBook Pro. I am using an external SSD for storage. My only regret is that I did not get more RAM. I frequently get warnings if I am using too many hungry applications.
Cathy,Very pleased with the newest Macbook Air with M2
homey,"very nice,very good, I like it"
Cassie,Works great for taking online classes
sai varun patel,">Coming to delivery: The product got delivered very very late.. also during delivery day it created lot of mess .. driver marked it as delivered but he actually didnt deliver it..
>Laptop review: Upto the mark ✔️✔️✔️
Undoubtedly tremendous performance!"
Eric Rose,"Just outstanding. Everything about it is 10 out of 10. Keyboard, function keys, trackpad, battery life, performance. I can drive a 32"" 4k 60MHz high-end monitor. Battery lasts all day, or a week if just using it intermittently. Webcam is great for the modern video conference age. Speakers and microphone are great. Just a pleasure to use every day."
Estela oro de Vargas,Pude encontrar una Super oferta en esta computadora en $999.00 más el impuesto 98 dólares más!!!! Pedí este desde Panamá 🇵🇦 el país me llego en una semana!!!! No tengo ninguna queja por ahora sobre el producto pero haré un update en unos meses!!!!
Susan Schultz,This laptop is great for high school students and for students in college who don’t need a top end Mac. This is one of the best purchases I have ever made!
